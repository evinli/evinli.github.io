Currently studying Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia with an avid interest for software engineering, design, and product management. I love problem-solving and the idea of bridging science and math with design to drive positive impact in the community. So far, I've worked with both clean energy and medtech startups doing firmware and automation engineering.
