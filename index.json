Built from 4 weeks of sleepless nights, many MANY cups of coffee, and the support of amazing TAs. Here is a quick recap of CHONKY\u0026rsquo;s evolution (music to come).\nThe challenge was to build a treasure-hunting robot completely from scratch that could recover lost treasures from temple ruins. To do so, the robot would need to follow tape along a ramp, cross a 6” chicken wire gap, differentiate and follow infrared signals, and pick up irregularly shaped treasure statues positioned on 2” pedestals - all in under 2 minutes.\nOur Design # After many long meetings in the UBC Hebb basement, we eventually settled on 3 DOF robotic arm design with rear-wheel drive.\nOn the mechanical side, we had an arm that consisted of 3 independent joints, encoded using potentiometers and DC motors to provide position feedback and reinforced with high gear ratios (eg. 40:1) to withstand heavy loading. Our chassis was primarily laser cut from hardboard, and our servo-actuated claw was wrapped with rubber bands to provide better grasp on oddly shaped objects.\nMy contributions were mostly on the electrical and software end of the project. I helped breadboard the initial IR filtration and tape-following circuits, soldered the power distribution boards, and designed the architecture for our software system.\nSoftware Architecture # To be added ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/projects/chonky/","section":"Projects","summary":"A treasure-hunting robot that can detect obstacles, retrieve treasures, and navigate autonomously.","title":"CHONKY"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/cohere-llm-api/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cohere LLM API"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/convolution-neural-network/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Convolution Neural Network"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/docker/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Docker"},{"content":"hhello\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/projects/edusphere/","section":"Projects","summary":"An AR language learning game submitted for Hack the North 2023, selected as one of twelve finalist projects.","title":"EduSphere"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/flask/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Flask"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/google-cloud-translation-api/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Google Cloud Translation API"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/leaflet/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Leaflet"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/opencv/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"OpenCV"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/openstreetmap/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"OpenStreetMap"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/pid-control/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PID Control"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/platformio/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PlatformIO"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/python/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Python"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/redis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Redis"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/reinforcement-learning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Reinforcement Learning"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/rest-apis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"REST APIs"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/ros/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ROS"},{"content":"hhello\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/projects/enph353/","section":"Projects","summary":"A self-driving virtual robot that uses deep learning and computer vision to classify license plates and navigate roads.","title":"Self-Driving AI Car"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/soldering/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Soldering"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/stm32-microcontroller/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"STM32 Microcontroller"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/tensorflow/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"TensorFlow"},{"content":"hhello\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/projects/aerodesign/","section":"Projects","summary":"A student design team that designs and builds fixed-wing aircraft to compete in the annual SAE Aero Design competition.","title":"UBC AeroDesign"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/zmq/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ZMQ"}]
