Hi!! My name is Evin, I'm currently studying eng phys at UBC with a focus in software and embedded systems. Recently, I've been playing with plane software and RF communication protocols for UBC AeroDesign as we design our plane for the 2025 SAE competition. I am also actively trying to apply more of the physics side of my degree by building a ICP fusion reactor for my senior capstone project!!

Off-campus, you can find me chasing the tail of my reading/movies list, hunting down the best places for Hong Kong style milk tea, and finding new reasons to throw hotpot dinner parties ü•òüçú
