I'm currently
- studying eng phys at UBC with a focus in software and embedded systems
- co-leading a team to build the avionics software for a SAE 2024 aircraft
- working with diffusion models to build a AI digital clone for my capstone
- forever growing my reading/movies list

I'm excited about...

- storytelling and documenting small mundane moments
- throwing hotpot dinner parties, raising baby ideas
- stargazing in places with zero light pollution
